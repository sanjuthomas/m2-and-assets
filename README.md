### Is there any major commodity that did not make any gain against the Dollar index
Yes. Look at the crude oil price for the last 10 years; despite the money supply increasing by 83%, the crude oil is just crude!

### What if you used a money market instrument to save your money
In the US, the Fed artificially kept the interest rate low for a very long period. As a result, you probably got a 2.5% annual yield.

Had you deposited 100 dollars in fixed deposit/CD 10 years ago, you're left with 128 dollars today. So, savers are losers, and debtors are winners.

### Conclusion
I know you are familiar with these concepts; you understand what inflation is and how central banks create it. But looking at those charts will leave a lasting impression on you.
When central banks cut interest rates and make money cheap, seize the opportunity to buy high-quality assets. Every time a bubble bursts, central banks will print more money out of thin air—and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. So, use their own weapon against them: DEBT.
